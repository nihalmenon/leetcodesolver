Welcome to the LeetcodeSolver Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). 

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.13 installed on your system. This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the LeetcodeSolver Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.
